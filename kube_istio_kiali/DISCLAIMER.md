A lot of information in these slides were taken from different websites,
blogs and articles - if not they are opinions on my own. I believe all
information I read, watched and heard to create these slides have its
references in the REFS.md file. This is an initial research on service
mesh observability. It is very likely I will improve, change and remove
some of the references and quotes along the way. for the record, none of
the ideas expressed in this presentation are shared, supported, or
endorsed in any manner by my employer.
